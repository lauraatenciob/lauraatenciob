## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Laura and I'm learning how to code 

I love making and designing webpages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I spend most of my time learning to solve different problems to create software anyone can easily use. 

I usually upload to Github the projects in which I make significant progress in my learning process. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own projects for learning purposes.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source/commercial projects.
- ðŸ˜„ In my free time, I like to do macrame, read, and sing my favorite songs loudly even if I mess up the words.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not the only programmer at home.
